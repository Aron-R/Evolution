    <h1  id="title"> Descent with modification </h1>

    <div id="descent"class="content-container" style="overflow: auto;">
        <p> We’ve defined evolution as descent with modification from a common ancestor, but exactly what has been modified? Evolution occurs when there is a change in the heritable information passed from one generation to the next.  
            Typically, we think of biological evolution as changes in gene frequency within a population over time – if, say, birds with genes that produce wide beaks went from being rare to being common over multiple generations. 
            But biological evolution also includes changes in DNA that does not code for genes and changes in heritable information not encoded in DNA at all. 
            In all of these cases, the modifications are heritable and can be passed on to the next generation — which is what really matters in evolution: long term change. 
            Here, we’ll focus on changes in genes and other genetic elements (e.g., in non-coding DNA) as they relate to evolution.

           <br> <br>1. Beetles on a diet
           Imagine the population experiences many years of drought in which there are few plants that the beetles can eat. <br>All the beetles have the same chances of survival and reproduction, but because of food restrictions, the beetles in later generations are smaller than the pre-drought generations of beetles. <br><br>
           2. Beetles of a different color <br> Most of the beetles in the population (say 90%) have a gene for green coloration and a few of them (10%) have a gene that makes them brown. <br>
           Several generations later, things have changed: brown beetles are more common and make up 70% of the population. <br> <br>

           Which example illustrates descent with modification? The difference in size in example 1 came about because of environmental influences — the low food supply — not because of a change in heritable information. Therefore, example 1 is not evolution. Because the small body size in this population was not genetically determined, it is temporary: if the beetles’ food supply is restored, this generation of small-bodied beetles will produce normal size offspring.

The shift in color frequency in example 2 is definitely evolution: these two generations of the same population are genetically different. There has been a change in heritable information, and this shift will be passed down to the next generation (possibly with further changes introduced).

        Natural selection is one of the basic mechanisms of evolution, along with mutation, migration, and genetic drift. <br>

Darwin’s grand idea of evolution by natural selection is relatively simple but often misunderstood. To see how it works, imagine a population of beetles: <br> <br>

1. There is variation in traits.
For example, some beetles are green and some are brown. <br> <br>
2. There is differential reproduction.
Since the environment can’t support unlimited population growth, not all individuals get to reproduce to their full potential. In this example, green beetles tend to get eaten by birds and survive to reproduce less often than brown beetles do. <br> <br>
3. There is heredity.
The surviving beetles (more of which are brown) have offspring of the same color because this trait has a genetic basis. <br> <br>
4. End result:The more advantageous trait, brown coloration, which allows the beetle to have more offspring, becomes more common in the population. If this process continues, eventually, all individuals in the population will be brown. <br> <br> <br> <br><br> <br>

    <h1  id="title"> Mechanisms of change </h1>


    <div id="mechanisms_of_change"class="content-container" style="overflow: auto;"> 
        <p>
            Each of these four processes is a basic mechanism of evolutionary change and is illustrated with an example of gene frequency change in a beetle population with brown and green individuals. <br> <br>
            <b>Mutation:</b>  A mutation could cause beetle parents with genes for bright green coloration to have offspring with a gene for brown coloration. That would make genes for brown coloration more frequent in the population than they were before the mutation. <br> <br>

            <b>Migration:</b>  Some individuals from a population of brown beetles might have moved into a population of green beetles. That would make genes for brown coloration more frequent in the green beetle population than they were before the brown beetles migrated into it. In evolutionary biology, migration is also called “gene flow.” <br> <br>

            <b>Genetic drift:</b>  In one generation, brown beetles happened to have many offspring survive to reproduce. In the same generation, a number of green beetles were killed randomly when someone stepped on them and had no offspring. The next generation had more brown beetles than the previous generation — but just by chance. These chance changes from generation to generation are known as genetic drift. <br> <br>

            <b>Natural selection:</b>  Imagine that green beetles are easier for birds to spot (and hence, eat). Thus, brown beetles are a little more likely to survive to produce offspring. They pass their genes for brown coloration on to their offspring. So in the next generation, brown beetles are more common than they were in the previous generation. <br> <br>
